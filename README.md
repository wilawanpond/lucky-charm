### Project Overview ðŸ’—
This project is written with only JavaScript and I followed the instructions step by step from Tim on his YouTube channel along with commented lots of things in my .js file. Here are what you will get from this project:

* Create a fun game to play!
* Create simple functions in JavaScript
* Create for and while loops in JavaScript
* Practice logical thinking (design the function of the game)
